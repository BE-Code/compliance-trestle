A reference to a resource that has the source controls of a mapping.,A reference to a resource that has the target controls of a mapping.,Identifies a specific edge within a source that is the subject of a mapping. The edge must be one of the following types: control:statement (A textual element of a control that defines part of the control's requirements.),Identifies a specific edge within a target that is the subject of a mapping. The edge must be one of the following types: control:statement .A textual element of a control that defines part of the control's requirements.,"The relationship type for the control(s) to control(s) mapping entry, which describes the relationship between the effective requirements of the specified source with respect to the target sets. The value must be one of the following (the requirements of the source are): equal-to:equivalent-to:subset-of:superset-of:intersects-with: (to the req of the target)",The relationship for the control(s) to control(s) mapping entry expressed as percentage. Example values for the type of relationship: equal-to:100:equivalent-to:100:subset-of:30:superset-of:130:intersects-with:30,"The relationship type for the Procedure2Procedure level of the mapping entry, which describes the relationship between the effective requirements of the specified source and target sets. The value must be one of the following: equal-to:equivalent-to:subset-of:superset-of:intersects-with: ",The relationship for the Procedure2Procedure level of the mapping entry expressed as percentage.
